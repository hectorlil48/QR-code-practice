### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned how to remake the QR-code using bootstrap, it made things easier to understand when I started getting more practice with it. I also wanted to test myself on what I've learned so far with Javascript. So I added a button that hides the QR-code but you can also unhide it.


### Continued development

I want to keep practing using bootstrap and Javascript, Im fairly new with using these but I hope to get better at them.


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap docs](https://www.bootstrap.com) - This helped me figure out how to make a card that I was able to redo the QR code.
- [MDN](https://www.mdn.com) - Helped me figure out how to add some styles and how to use some Javascript.
